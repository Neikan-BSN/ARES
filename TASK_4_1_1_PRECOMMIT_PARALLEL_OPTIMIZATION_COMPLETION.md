- **Hook-level Settings**: Added `require_serial: false` to all independent hooks
- **Parallel Configuration**: Added `parallel_mode: true` for CI optimization
- **Secrets Scanning**: Configured `--cores 4` for parallel secret detection

#### Hook Organization:
- **Group 1**: Fast Environment & Language Checks
- **Group 2**: Code Quality & Formatting (Ruff)
- **Group 3**: AI Agent-Specific Validations
- **Group 4**: Security & Secrets Detection
- **Group 5**: File Format Validation

### 2. Makefile Integration

**File Modified**: `Makefile`

#### New Targets Added:
```makefile
precommit-parallel    # Optimized parallel execution (FAST)
