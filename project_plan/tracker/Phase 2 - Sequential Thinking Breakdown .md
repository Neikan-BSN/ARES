 Phase 2 - Sequential Thinking Breakdown ðŸ”„ Active

  The orchestrator has identified the logical adaptation sequence:
  1. Preserve core documentation capabilities
  2. Add ARES agent reliability monitoring
  3. Adapt to FastAPI microservice architecture
  4. Integrate proof-of-work validation
  5. Connect with ARES's 26-agent coordination system

  Phase 3 - ARES Integration Design ðŸ“‹ Planned

  - FastAPI endpoints designed for documentation task management
  - Agent coordination integration with ARES AgentCoordinationService
  - SQLAlchemy models planned for documentation task tracking
  - Reliability monitoring hooks for quality scoring

  Phase 4 - Implementation Coordination ðŸš§ Ready

  - Core service implementation with DocumentationAgentService
  - Reliability integration with task completion verification
  - MCP server integration leveraging SQLite and code quality tools

  Phase 5 - Validation & Quality âš¡ Staged

  - Code review against ARES standards
  - Performance optimization for real-time requirements
  - Comprehensive documentation creation

  Key Integration Points Identified

  1. Agent Registration: Full integration with ARES agent tracking system
  2. Task Coordination: Works with tech-lead-orchestrator for intelligent routing
  3. Quality Gates: Proof-of-work validation for documentation deliverables
  4. Real-time Monitoring: WebSocket updates for task progress
  5. MCP Integration: Leverages existing ARES MCP server tools

  The orchestrator has successfully analyzed the source Documentation Agent and created a detailed
  roadmap for adaptation while maintaining ARES's agent reliability monitoring standards and respecting
   the constraint that .claude/agents/*.md files cannot be moved.
