- Create MCP client libraries for integration

### Week 8: API & Dashboard

#### 1. REST API Completion
- Complete all REST endpoints
- Build comprehensive web dashboard
- Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- Create API documentation with automated generation

## Phase 5: Workspace Integration (Weeks 9-10)

### Week 9: Project-Specific Integrations

#### 1. Clean Integration Implementation

- Test rollback scenarios and recovery procedures
- Performance optimization and resource tuning

## Phase 6: Production Hardening (Weeks 11-12)

### Week 11: Security & Performance

#### 1. Production Preparation
- Comprehensive security audit and hardening
- Performance optimization and scaling preparation
- Load testing and capacity planning

### Week 12: Deployment & Launch

#### 1. Go-Live Preparation
- Production deployment configuration
- Monitoring and alerting system setup
- Final integration testing and user training
- Rollout planning and execution

## Core Technical Architecture

### Five Main Components

1. **CompletionVerifier**: Task completion validation engine
2. **ToolCallValidator**: MCP tool invocation verification
3. **TaskRollbackManager**: State rollback and recovery
4. **ProofOfWorkCollector**: Evidence collection and validation
5. **AgentBehaviorMonitor**: Behavioral pattern analysis

### Integration Strategy

- **Clean Separation**: MCP protocol integration without code dependencies
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous verification requests/responses
- **Configuration-Based**: YAML configs for project-specific rules
- **REST API Interface**: HTTP endpoints for external integrations

## Technology Stack (Workspace Consistent)

- **Python 3.11+** with UV package management
- **FastAPI** for microservice architecture
- **PostgreSQL** (production) / **SQLite** (development)
- **Redis** for caching and messaging
- **Docker Compose** for orchestration
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **Doppler** for secrets management

## Template Utilization Benefits

- **80% Time Reduction**: From weeks to hours for foundation
- **100% Consistency**: Identical tooling across workspace
- **Zero Configuration Drift**: Standardized templates
- **Proven Reliability**: Battle-tested configurations

## Success Metrics

- **Setup Time**: ARES functional within 2 hours
- **Development Velocity**: 50% faster than original timeline
- **Verification Accuracy**: >95% detection of incomplete tasks
- **Performance Impact**: <5% overhead on existing workflows
- **Test Coverage**: >95% across all components

## Integration Points

- **RAGnostic**: Processor job completion verification
- **ACF-v2**: Multi-agent coordination validation
- **Slicer-v2**: 3D printing optimization confirmation
- **Shared Services**: Database, filesystem, API response validation
