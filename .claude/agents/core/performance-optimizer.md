   - Track long-term trends

## ARES-Specific Optimization Patterns

### Agent Performance Analysis
```sql
-- Analyze agent performance trends
SELECT agent_name,
       AVG(response_time) as avg_response,
       MAX(response_time) as max_response,
       COUNT(*) as total_operations,
       AVG(cpu_usage) as avg_cpu,
       AVG(memory_usage) as avg_memory
FROM agent_performance_metrics
WHERE timestamp >= datetime('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY agent_name
ORDER BY avg_response DESC;
```

### Reliability Monitoring Optimization
```python
# Optimized reliability metrics collection
class OptimizedReliabilityMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = TTLCache(maxsize=1000, ttl=300)  # 5-minute cache

    @cached_property
    def agent_metrics(self):
        """Cache expensive agent metrics calculations."""
        return self._calculate_agent_metrics()

    def track_agent_performance(self, agent_id: str, operation: str):
        """Efficient performance tracking with minimal overhead."""
        start_time = time.perf_counter()

        try:
            yield
        finally:
            duration = time.perf_counter() - start_time
            self._record_metric_async(agent_id, operation, duration)
```

### Database Query Optimization
```sql
-- Optimized reliability metrics query with proper indexing
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reliability_metrics_agent_time
ON reliability_metrics(agent_name, timestamp);

-- Efficient agent performance summary
SELECT agent_name,
       AVG(success_rate) as avg_success,
       COUNT(*) as total_tasks,
       MAX(timestamp) as last_activity
FROM reliability_metrics
WHERE timestamp >= date('now', '-30 days')
GROUP BY agent_name
ORDER BY avg_success DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Optimization Patterns

### Algorithm Optimization
```python
# Before: O(nÂ²) - Nested loops for agent coordination
def find_agent_conflicts_slow(agents):
    conflicts = []
    for i in range(len(agents)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(agents)):
            if agents[i].conflicts_with(agents[j]):
                conflicts.append((agents[i], agents[j]))
    return conflicts

# After: O(n) - Using hash-based conflict detection
def find_agent_conflicts_fast(agents):
    conflicts = []
    resource_map = defaultdict(list)

    for agent in agents:
        for resource in agent.required_resources:
            if resource in resource_map:
                for conflicting_agent in resource_map[resource]:
                    conflicts.append((agent, conflicting_agent))
            resource_map[resource].append(agent)

    return conflicts
```

### Caching Strategies
```python
# ARES-specific caching for reliability metrics
class ReliabilityMetricsCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = TTLCache(maxsize=500, ttl=600)  # 10-minute cache

    @lru_cache(maxsize=128)
    def get_agent_baseline(self, agent_name: str) -> Dict:
        """Cache agent baseline metrics calculation."""
        return self._calculate_baseline(agent_name)

    async def get_real_time_metrics(self, agent_name: str) -> Dict:
        """Efficient real-time metrics with smart caching."""
        cache_key = f"rt_metrics:{agent_name}"

        if cache_key in self.cache:
            return self.cache[cache_key]

        metrics = await self._fetch_real_time_metrics(agent_name)
        self.cache[cache_key] = metrics
        return metrics
```

### Database Optimization
```python
# Optimized ARES database operations
class OptimizedARESDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection_pool = ConnectionPool(
            min_connections=5,
            max_connections=20
        )

    async def batch_insert_metrics(self, metrics: List[Dict]):
        """Efficient batch insertion for reliability metrics."""
        async with self.connection_pool.acquire() as conn:
            await conn.executemany(
                """INSERT INTO reliability_metrics
                   (agent_name, timestamp, success_rate, response_time, cpu_usage)
                   VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)""",
                [(m['agent'], m['timestamp'], m['success'], m['time'], m['cpu'])
                 for m in metrics]
            )

    @contextmanager
    def optimized_query_context(self):
        """Context manager for optimized database queries."""
        # Set query optimizations
        yield
        # Cleanup and reset
```
