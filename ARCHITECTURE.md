## System Architecture

```
[Agent Registry] ↔ [Execution Engine] ↔ [Memory Store]
       ↓               ↓                   ↓
[Agent Pool]      [Task Scheduler]     [Knowledge Graph]
       ↓               ↓                   ↓
[Agent DB]        [Event Queue]       [Vector Memory]
```

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Registry
- **Purpose**: Agent discovery and registration
- **Technology**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy
- **Responsibilities**: Agent lifecycle, capability mapping

### 2. Execution Engine
- **Purpose**: Agent task execution
- **Technology**: asyncio + celery
- **Responsibilities**: Task distribution, execution monitoring

### 3. Memory Store
- **Purpose**: Agent memory and knowledge management
- **Technology**: Neo4j + vector database
- **Responsibilities**: Knowledge persistence, memory retrieval

## Agent Capabilities

- **Reasoning**: Logical inference and problem solving
- **Learning**: Adaptive behavior and knowledge acquisition
- **Communication**: Inter-agent messaging and coordination
- **Execution**: Task completion and result reporting

## Memory Architecture

- **Working Memory**: Short-term task context
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent knowledge storage
- **Episodic Memory**: Experience and interaction history
- **Semantic Memory**: Structured knowledge representation
